# Fun-Captcha-Ai

Fun captcha is a type of captcha service which requires you to correctly rotate an image so that it is upright using arrows on the screen. Data_gather.py gathers fun captcha images then requires you to sort the new data into a folder of incorrectly rotated captchas and a folder of correctly rotated captchas. Set_data.py converts the new data to grey scale and into a numpy array which then pickle is used to output the arrays to a file. Train.py uses the new pickle files to train multiple models with different layers and validation splits. You can use the log files with tensorboard to get a visual graph on the epoch validation accuracy, loss as well as just the epoch accuracy, and loss. Using the info from the graph you can choose the best performing models to run against validation_test.py. Validation_test.py runs each model through a set of captchas with all possible rotations and will ensure that the models only choose one image out of the seven image rotations as the correctly rotated image. You can then look through the results to see if the models make the correct predictions.

Note:
To gather data using data_gather.py you will be required to gather your own set of images to use in place of the ones already in the lib folder because of different screen resolutions and scalings.
